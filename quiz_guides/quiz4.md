# Quiz 4

The fourth quiz will be held **in lab on Tuesday, 3/28**.  The topics will be hypothesis testing, gradient descent, and linear regression.

The in-class exercsises (available on the course website) is a good resource for studying.  I encourage you to discuss these exercises on piazza if you have questions about them.  For linear regression, you are also encouraged to look at the questions at the end of [ISL Ch. 3](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), especially questions 1, 3, and 4.  Again, you are encouraged to use Piazza to discuss.  For gradient descent, you should understand the code from lab 5 well.
