# Quiz 1

The first quiz will be held in-class on Wednesday, 2/22.  Because there is no lecture that day due to my travel schedule, you will have the entire class period to work on it (though I do not expect it will take you that long).  

## Possible Topics

The following topics *may* appear on the quiz.  For topic, I provide some suggested ways to study.  In general, it's always a good idea to review the lecture slides, especially the small exercises we do in class.  If you are unsure of the answer to an exercise in class, post a question on piazza!  (And if you know the answer to someone else's question, answer it and earn points for class participation.)

- Regular expressions (Lecture 3).  If you feel like you need a little more practice with regular expressions, here's a [website with some good practice problems](https://regexone.com/problem/matching_decimal_numbers).
- External merge sort (Lecture 4).  You should understand the basic concept and be able to explain the answer to the quiz question that was asked in class.
- Solving problems with sorting and streaming (Lecture 4).  Given a problem such as the ones posed during lecture 4, be able to describe (pseudocode is fine) how to solve the problem efficiently and respecting any constraints on the size of the available memory relative to the dataset.  Your solution can combine streaming algorithms with out-of-core algorithms that can accomplish the rendezvous (e.g., sorting, recursive hashing).  The tasks in Lab 2 are also examples of this kind of task.  If you worked with a partner, make sure you understand all aspects of your lab 2 solution.
- Levenshtein (edit) distance (Lecture 7).  Given two strings *s* and *t*, be able to compute the edit distance between them.  The lecture repo includes a **notebook with edit distance code**.  You are strongly encouraged to use that code to check your understanding.

## Omitted Topics

The following topics *will not* appear on Quiz 1 but may appear on a future quiz.  

- SQL (Lectures 5 and 6)
- Statistics (Lecture 8)
